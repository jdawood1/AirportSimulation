# Airport Simulationâ€”Design Patterns

## Initial Plan
This project will implement three GoF design patterns in an airport simulation:
1. **Singleton** - Managing a central airport control system.
2. **Observer** - Notifying different airport components of flight status updates.
3. **Strategy** - Handling different passenger check-in strategies.

## Setup
- Clone the repository
- Run `./gradlew build` to build the project
- Run `./gradlew run` to execute the simulation
